## What is Terract?

Terract is a component-based, declarative UI framework for building real terminal applications — inspired by React and Next.js, built entirely from scratch. File-system routing, hooks, animations, real-time data, permissions, and more. All inside your terminal.

---

## Why Terract?

- **Declarative** — describe what your terminal UI looks like, not how to draw it
- **Routing** — file-system based screen routing, just like Next.js
- **Real-time** — built-in WebSocket engine, live data, live UI
- **Secure** — Terract Shield forces permission prompts on every system access. Always.
- **Flexible** — no one right way. Your app, your structure, your style
- **For everyone** — beginner or pro, Terract gets out of your way
